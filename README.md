# Mental Health in Tech Case Study
---

This self-led project was done as a conclusion to the Google Data Analytics Certification course, where I completed a case study capstone project, demonstrating my understanding of the data analytics process.

# Project Description
**Guiding Question**: How can tech companies identify and address key workplace barriers to mental health support?

**Business Task**: Analyze survey data to uncover patterns between company-provided mental health resources (like benefits, leave, and education) and employees' likelihood to seek treatment or disclose mental health concerns

# Data Source
[Mental Health in Tech Survey (2014)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/osmi/mental-health-in-tech-survey/data)
This dataset is from a 2014 survey that measures attitudes towards mental health and frequency of mental health disorders in the tech workplace. This data was collected by the OSMI (Open Sourcing Mental Health) non profit which is dedicated to raising awareness to support mental wellness in the tech community.

### Data Includes:
- Demographics (Age, Gender, Country)
- Workplace info (remote work, no_employees, tech_company)
- Perception of company support (benefits, wellness_program, anonymity, etc.)
- Outcomes (treatment, work_interfere, etc.)
 

# Analysis Questions
- Are employees with benefits more likely to seek treatment?
- Are people in smaller companies less likely to feel safe disclosing mental health conditions?
- Does awareness of care options predict willingness to talk to supervisors?
- Do remote workers perceive more or less stigma?
- How do the attitudes towards mental health vary by geographic location?
 

# Tools Used
- Excel - Data preparation & analysis
- Tableau (Desktop) - Visualization & analysis
